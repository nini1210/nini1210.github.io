  <h1>春天的诗歌</h1>
  <body style="background-color:lavender">
    <marquee><b>I offer you lean streets, desperate sunsets, the moon of the jagged suburbs.

  I offer you the bitterness of a man who has looked long and long at the lonely moon.

  I offer you my ancestors, my dead men, the ghosts that living men have honoured in marble: my father’s father killed in the frontier of Buenos Aires, two bullets through his lungs, bearded and dead, wrapped by his soldiers in the hide of a cow;

  my mother’s grandfather -just twentyfour- heading a charge of three hundred men in Perú, now ghosts on vanished horses.I offer you whatever insight my books may hold. whatever manliness or humour my life.

  I offer you the loyalty of a man who has never been loyal.

  I offer you that kernel of myself that I have saved somehow -the central heart that deals not in words, traffics not with dreams and is untouched by time, by joy, by adversities.

  I offer you the memory of a yellow rose seen at sunset, years before you were born.

  I offer you explanationsof yourself, theories about yourself, authentic and surprising news of yourself.

  I can give you my loneliness, my darkness, the hunger of my heart; I am trying to bribe you with uncertainty, with danger, with defeat</b></marquee>
